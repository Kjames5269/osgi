 * INSTALLED: The OSGi runtime knows the bundle is there.
 * RESOLVED: The bundle is there and all itâ€™s prerequisites (dependencies) are available. The bundle can be started (or has been stopped).
 * STARTING: The bundle is being started. If it has a BundleActivator class, the BundleActivator.start() method is being executed. When done, the bundle will become ACTIVE. Note: Bundles that can be activated lazily (Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy) stay in this state until one of their class files is loaded.
 * ACTIVE: The bundle is running.
 * STOPPING: The bundle is being stopped. If it has a BundleActivator class, the BundleActivator.stop() method is being executed. When done, the bundle will become RESOLVED.
 * UNINSTALLED: The bundle has been removed from the OSGi runtime.
