# OSGi Learning Laboratory

### Getting started with OSGi
Learn the pillars of OSGi:
* Modularity
* Module lifecycle
* Services
  * Registering and retrieving services
  * Separating programming interfaces from implementations
  
----

## Lesson 1: Bundles

* Create a bundle 
  * Activator class
  * Bundle Context
  * Maven Bundle Plugin
* Install a bundle
* Start, stop, resolve a bundle

## Lesson 2: Add a Logger
* Add logging interface as dependency
* Use logging 

## Lesson 3: Add a Bundle Listener
* Spying on other bundles

## Lesson 4: Add a Tracker
* Tired of listening? Start tracking!

## Lesson 5: Create a Service
* Services instead of methods or functions
* Service as POJO
* Registering a service programmatically

## Lesson 6: Consuming a service
* Getting hold of a service programmatically

## Lesson 7: API
